Importing Libraries
python


from tkinter import *
from time import *
from tkinter import *: This imports all the functions, classes, and constants from the tkinter library, which is used for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in Python.
from time import *: This imports all functions from the time module, which provides various time-related functions.
Defining the update Function
python


def update():
    time_string = strftime("%I:%M:%S %p")
    time_label.config(text=time_string)

    day_string = strftime("%A")
    day_label.config(text=day_string)

    date_string = strftime("%B %d, %Y")
    date_label.config(text=date_string)

    window.after(1000, update)
def update():: This defines a function named update which will be used to refresh the time, day, and date displayed on the labels.
time_string = strftime("%I:%M:%S %p"): This gets the current time formatted as hours, minutes, and seconds with an AM/PM indicator (e.g., "02:30:45 PM").
time_label.config(text=time_string): This updates the text of the time_label to the current time string.
day_string = strftime("%A"): This gets the current day of the week (e.g., "Monday").
day_label.config(text=day_string): This updates the text of the day_label to the current day string.
date_string = strftime("%B %d, %Y"): This gets the current date formatted as month day, year (e.g., "July 27, 2024").
date_label.config(text=date_string): This updates the text of the date_label to the current date string.
window.after(1000, update): This sets up a timer to call the update function again after 1000 milliseconds (1 second), creating a loop that continuously updates the time, day, and date.
Creating the Main Window
python


window = Tk()
window = Tk(): This creates the main application window.
Creating and Configuring Labels
python

time_label = Label(window, font=("Arial", 50), fg="#00FF00", bg="black")
time_label.pack()

day_label = Label(window, font=("Ink Free", 25, "bold"))
day_label.pack()

date_label = Label(window, font=("Ink Free", 30))
date_label.pack()
time_label = Label(window, font=("Arial", 50), fg="#00FF00", bg="black"): This creates a label for displaying the time. The font is set to Arial with a size of 50, the foreground (text) color is set to green (#00FF00), and the background color is set to black.
time_label.pack(): This packs the time_label into the window, making it visible.
day_label = Label(window, font=("Ink Free", 25, "bold")): This creates a label for displaying the day. The font is set to Ink Free with a size of 25 and bold style.
day_label.pack(): This packs the day_label into the window.
date_label = Label(window, font=("Ink Free", 30)): This creates a label for displaying the date. The font is set to Ink Free with a size of 30.
date_label.pack(): This packs the date_label into the window.
Initializing the Update Loop and Running the Application
python

update()
window.mainloop()
update(): This calls the update function for the first time, starting the update loop.
window.mainloop(): This starts the Tkinter event loop, which waits for events (such as button clicks or updates) and updates the GUI accordingly. The program will keep running until the window is closed.
Summary
The program creates a simple digital clock using the Tkinter library for the GUI and the time module for fetching the current time, day, and date.
It defines an update function that refreshes the displayed time, day, and date every second.
It creates and configures three labels to display the time, day, and date.
It starts the update loop and runs the Tkinter event loop to keep the application running.
